Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an approach that combines information retrieval
with text generation. In a RAG system, relevant documents are first retrieved from a
knowledge base using vector similarity. These retrieved documents are then provided
as context to a language model, which generates a response grounded in factual information.
RAG helps reduce hallucinations and allows models to work with updated data.
