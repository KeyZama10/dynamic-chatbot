Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
These systems are designed to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
and decision-making. AI systems can be categorized into narrow AI, which performs a
specific task, and general AI, which can perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
