Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from
data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning models identify patterns
in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. Common types of
machine learning include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
